If you're an Evernote user on macOS, you might find yourself wanting to print documents or web pages directly into Evernote for easy organization and access later. Here's how to set it up:

From the Print dialog, instead of clicking the PDF button, click on the dropdown arrow and check that Send to Evernote isn’t already in the list (the name may be slightly different). If not, click Edit Menu… (1).
